Features dual panes (one for tiers, one for images), full control over tier colors, tier reordering, image exporting, save files, and more!

This program was made as my answer to the tiermaker website, as myself and my friends were starting to get annoyed with certain things about it and we make tierlists for fun quite a bit. This program isn't perfect, but I am continously working on it. you can find the latest release under "Releases". Enjoy!
