Features dual panes (one for tiers, one for images), full control over tier colors, tier reordering, image exporting, save files, and more!

This program was made as my answer to the tiermaker website, as myself and my friends were starting to get annoyed with certain things about it and we make tierlists for fun quite a bit. This program isn't perfect, but I am continously working on it. you can find the latest release under "Releases". Details on certain features of the program are listed below. Enjoy!


## Saving a list
When you're finished with your list and want to share it with others you can do so by clicking the save button on the top bar. Your list will be converted into an image and you will be given the option to save it to your computer or to copy it to your clipboard.

## Importing and exporting a list
You can use the export button on the top bar to export a list as a .json file. If you ever want to come back to a list you can import this .json file and continue from where you left off. keep in mind that tierlister references the images in their locations on your computer/online, so if an image is no longer on your computer or a link to an image is dead it will not be there when the list is imported.

## Changing image size
The image size sliders will adjust the size of images on their respective panes.
